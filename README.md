Evaluating the social influences that impact vaccination: Online surveys
===============

Through online surveys, we will assess the cross-cultural differences in the role of prosociality on vaccination in the USA, Japan, China, Israel, and Brazil. The results of these surveys will be shared in this repository.

The surveys address the following questions:

1. the likelihood of becoming infected and of infecting others with and without being vaccinated;
2. willingness to pay for hypothetical cures for the flu that either do or do not prevent the recipient from spreading the flu virus;
3. the respondent’s contact structure;
4. whether the respondent would vaccinate in a hypothetical population consisting of varying numbers of babies, adults, and elderly adults, assuming the respondent was a possible carrier but immune to the virus;
5. the personal qualities of the respondent’s contacts (e.g., whether the contact is responsible, caring, knowledgeable, popular) and whether those contacts were vaccinated the previous year;
6. whether the respondent tried to influence or was influenced by the vaccination decisions of members of their household;
7. messages designed to encourage prosociality, along with measures of empathy, prosociality, and intentions to vaccinate (collected after respondents read the messages).
